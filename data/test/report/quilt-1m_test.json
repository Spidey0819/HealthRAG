So a plasma cell is the best example, and it is the best reference where you can classify the different nuclear features. So if you look carefully, the plasma cell has got a cartwheel-like of an appearance. So it is called cartwheel because you see some areas which are darkly strained. So they are the high heterochromatin areas, that is the darkly strained areas. And then in some areas, you see that there is light straining, which is the euchromatin area. So basically, the chromatin that we see in the nucleus is of two types, heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin is going to appear darker, whereas the euchromatin will appear lighter on the cell. So similarly, when we see here in this cell nucleus, we see that there are dark and lightly strained areas. And this is what we call as heterochromatin and euchromatin.

Clinically, this patient had PLC, or pittoriasis liganoides chronica. I tend to view pittoriasis liganoides as running along a spectrum. A lot of times, we'll refer to the entire spectrum as Leuka Habermann disease, with pittoriasis liganoides chronica being on the one end of the spectrum, and pleva being on the other end of the spectrum, PLC being characterized by more scaly macules or scaly papules, and pleva being characterized by more crusted and eroded papulonecrotic type lesions. But the histology of the two conditions is actually quite similar. It's a matter of degree. With pleva, you're more likely the acute form of the condition to see more spongiosis, ballooning, necrosis, a denser infiltrate, more necrotics along the DEJ, pericaratosis containing neutrophils. With PLC, similar findings, just a little more blunt. The inflammatory infiltrate may be present around the superficial plexus only. One usually can see some pericaratosis, but there aren't as many necrotic keratinocytes along the DEJ, and a lot of times, the alterations within the epidermis are more subtle. But this was an example of biopsy from a patient with clinically documented pittoriasis like in wades clonica. Moving on to slide number 10. This was, I thought, a really cool case.

In some areas, there were a few extravasated erythrocytes, a few of which were carried up into the overlying epidermis. This constellation of findings is most suggestive of pityriasis lichenoides. Clinically, this patient had PLC, or pityriasis lichenoides chronica. I tend to view pityriasis lichenoides as running along a spectrum. A lot of times, we'refer to the entire spectrum as Leuka Habermann disease, with pityriasis lichenoides chronica being on the one end of the spectrum, and pleva being on the other end of the spectrum, PLC being characterized by more scaly macules or scaly papules, and pleva being characterized by more crusted and eroded papulonecrotic type lesions. But the histology of the two conditions is actually quite similar. It's a matter of degree. With pleva, you're more likely the acute form of the condition to see more spongiosis, ballooning, necrosis, a denser infiltrate, more necrotic along the DEJ, parakeratosis containing neutrophils. With PLC, similar findings, just a little more blunt. The inflammatory infiltrate may be present around the superficial plexus only. One usually can see some parakeratosis, but there aren't as many necrotic keratinocytes along the DEJ, and a lot of times, the alterations within the epidermis are more subtle. But this was an example of biopsy from a patient with clinically documented pittoriasis like in chronica. Moving on to slide number 10. This was, I thought, a really cool case. This was a fragmented biopsy specimen, and you can see that the stain is quite bluish. I can't",

        "noisy_text": " Something else you may have observed with this case is the fact that it's not just a stroma process. It looks like there's something else going on in the glands, too. And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia. The other observation I want to bring to your attention is the fact that this process is going in between benign glands, which means that it's almost respecting the benign glands next door. Because there are a number of processes that would destroy the adjacent benign glands and basically push them aside. But this process actually respects the benign glands, in quotes, and is actually going in between them, infiltrating in between them. And that's a clue to the diagnosis. Because as I hinted earlier, when you talk of tumors of the specialized prosthetic stroma, there are two main entities you think about. One is the so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. And the other entity at the other extreme is the so-called prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. Some argue that there's some relationship between both of them that are in the spectrum. But what you're looking at right now in this case, based on what I've shown you, this type of atypia, it almost looks simplistic. It has this degenerative type of look to it. We are not seeing mitotic activity. For something this ugly or that looks this nasty, you'll expect to see necrosis, mitotic activity, and even destruction of the adjacent glands. But we're not seeing that. And that's kind of a perfect picture for so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. As I said earlier, there's a relationship between this entity and prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. To start with, STOMPs can recur. About 15% of STOMPs can recur months or years after the initial resection. But about 15% to 20% of STOMPs may progress or may be associated with adjacent prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So that's a very important thing to know. Because STOMP itself, as the name implies, is of unsaturated malignant potential. So it should not be downplayed. Because some of you may ask me, how do I sign all these cases? It's very important in your comments to document what I just said, that about 15% of these, if it's just STOMP is here on the H&E, nothing else, it's important to document that about 15% would recur. And more importantly, it's important to document that about 15% to 20% of these may be associated with or progress to prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So it's not a case of they excise this and they leave the patient alone. They need to follow up these patients very closely. So that's very important to document in the report. So some of you may ask, OK, so what stains do we do for these cases? Obviously, you want to exclude a number of things. We talked about melanoma and other things. So you want to exclude those. So obviously, HMB45 melanin, those will be negative. Vimentin, which nobody uses anymore, is actually positive in this entity. PR could also be positive in this entity. Plus or minus CD34, plus or minus Desmin SMA, plus or minus ER may be positive, but it's usually negative. The pertinent negative stains are S100. I talked about the melanoma markers. And STAT6 is also negative. So it's very important to know that. So this is a stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. There have been a number of names for this entity over the years.",
        "corrected_text": " Something else you may have observed with this case is the fact that it's not just a stroma process. It looks like there's something else going on in the glands, too. And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia. The other observation I want to bring to your attention is the fact that this process is going in between benign glands, which means that it's almost respecting the benign glands next door. Because there are a number of processes that would destroy the adjacent benign glands and basically push them aside. But this process actually respects the benign glands, in quotes, and is actually going in between them, infiltrating in between them. And that's a clue to the diagnosis. Because as I hinted earlier, when you talk of tumors of the specialized prosthetic stroma, there are two main entities you think about. One is the so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. And the other entity at the other extreme is the so-called prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. Some argue that there's some relationship between both of them that are in the spectrum. But what you're looking at right now in this case, based on what I've shown you, this type of atypia, it almost looks simplistic. It has this degenerative type of look to it. We are not seeing mitotic activity. For something this ugly or that looks this nasty, you'expect to see necrosis, mitotic activity, and even destruction of the adjacent glands. But we're not seeing that. And that's kind of a perfect picture for so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. As I said earlier, there's a relationship between this entity and prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. To start with, STOMPs can recur. About 15% of STOMPs can recur months or years after the initial resection. But about 15% to 20% of STOMPs may progress or may be associated with adjacent prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So that's a very important thing to know. Because STOMP itself, as the name implies, is of unsaturated malignant potential. So it should not be downplayed. Because some of you may ask me, how do I sign all these cases? It's very important in your comments to document what I just said, that about 15% of these, if it's just STOMP is here on the H&E, nothing else, it's important to document that about 15% would recur. And more importantly, it's important to document that about 15% to 20% of these may be associated with or progress to prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So it's not a case of they excise this and they leave the patient alone. They need to follow up these patients very closely. So that's very important to document in the report. So some of you may ask, OK, so what stains do we do for these cases? Obviously, you want to exclude a number of things. We talked about melanoma and other things. So you want to exclude those. So obviously, HMB45 melanin, those will be negative. Vimentin, which nobody uses anymore, is actually positive in this entity. PR could also be positive in this entity. Plus or minus CD34, plus or minus Desmin SMA, plus or minus ER may be positive, but it's usually negative. The pertinent negative stains are S100. I talked about the melanoma markers. And STAT6 is also negative. So it's very important to know that. So this is a stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. There have been a number of names for this entity over the years.",

No, it's not coming up. Yeah, it is. Yeah, here you go. Just the red one. Yeah. Oh, I don't see it. It's okay. Is the mouse going to work? Yeah, I'll do the mouse. Yeah, it works. Okay. Basically, I like to see my colonic crypts nice and straight coming from the surface, trying to kiss that muscularis mucosa underneath in between the crypts and the muscularis mucosa. I don't want to see any lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils. You can have one or two. That's okay, but typically no basal lymphoplasma cytosis. The other thing I like to point out is the amount of lamina propria in between the crypts is the same as you move from one crypt to another. The crypts stand equidistant one from another.

Case number 10 is a 58-year-old gentleman with a positive digital rectal examination and elevated PSA level. So right off the bat, you can appreciate that this is an",

And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia. The other observation I want to bring to your attention is the fact that this process is going in between benign glands, which means that it's almost respecting the benign glands next door. Because there are a number of processes that would destroy the adjacent benign glands and basically push them aside. But this process actually respects the benign glands, in quotes, and is actually going in between them, infiltrating in between them. And that's a clue to the diagnosis. Because as I hinted earlier, when you talk of tumors of the specialized prosthetic stroma, there are two main entities you think about. One is the so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. And the other entity at the other extreme is the so-called prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. Some argue that there's some relationship between both of them that are in the spectrum. But what you're looking at right now in this case, based on what I've shown you, this type of atypia, it almost looks simplistic. It has this degenerative type of look to it. We are not seeing mitotic activity. For something this ugly or that looks this nasty, you'll expect to see necrosis, mitotic activity, and even destruction of the adjacent glands. But we're not seeing that. And that's kind of a perfect picture for so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. As I said earlier, there's a relationship between this entity and prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. To start with, STOMPs can recur. About 15% of STOMPs can recur months or years after the initial resection. But about 15% to 20% of STOMPs may progress or may be associated with adjacent prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So that's a very important thing to know. Because STOMP itself, as the name implies, is of unsaturated malignant potential. So it should not be downplayed. Because some of you may ask me, how do I sign all these cases? It's very important in your comments to document what I just said, that about 15% of these, if it's just STOMP is here on the H&E, nothing else, it's important to document that about 15% would recur. And more importantly, it's important to document that about 15% to 20% of these may be associated with or progress to prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So it's not a case of they excise this and they leave the patient alone. They need to follow up these patients very closely. So that's very important to document in the report. So some of you may ask, OK, so what stains do we do for these cases? Obviously, you want to exclude a number of things. We talked about melanoma and other things. So you want to exclude those. So obviously, HMB45 melanin, those will be negative. Vimentin, which nobody uses anymore, is actually positive in this entity. PR could also be positive in this entity. Plus or minus CD34, plus or minus Desmin SMA, plus or minus ER may be positive, but it's usually negative. The pertinent negative stains are S100. I talked about the melanoma markers. And STAT6 is also negative. So it's very important to know that. So this is a stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. There have been a number of names for this entity over the years.",

It's really a neoplasm that causes problems because of its diffuse nature. Some cancers are aggressive because they metastasize. Some are more aggressive because they just like crab.

And how are you going to differentiate these nuclear features? So let's see some of the nuclear features. And before we move on to describe these features, I think the first thing that we should look at and understand what we are meaning by hyperchromasia and vesicularism is to look at a plasma cell. So a plasma cell is the best example, and it is the best reference where you can classify the different nuclear features. So if you look carefully, the plasma cell has got a cartwheel-like of an appearance. So it is called cartwheel because you see some areas which are darkly strained. So they are the high heterochromatin areas, that is the darkly strained areas. And then in some areas, you see that there is light straining, which is the euchromatin area. So basically, the chromatin that we see in the nucleus is of two types, heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin is going to appear darker, whereas the euchromatin will appear lighter on the cell. So similarly, when we see here in this cell nucleus, we see that there are dark and lightly strained areas. And this is what we call as heterochromatin and euchromatin. So suppose in a cell which has mainly heterochromatin, so the entire nucleus is going to look very dark. So those are the cells that we are going to call as hyperchromatic. And if a nucleus is composed of mainly euchromatin, then it will look very lightly strained. And this is what we call as vesicular nuclei. Now to know here what is important is that in a vesicular nuclei, the nucleus is very actively dividing. So if you have not a vesicular nuclei, that in itself will tell you that the cell is very actively proliferating. So let's see one example of vesicular nuclei here. So these",

You have the P63, you have the hemoglobin cytokeratin, and then you have the racemase, which is the pink chromogen. And as you can see, as I demonstrated on the H&E, basal cells are indeed present. This is too much for high-grade pin. This is basically what is called a solid cribriform kind of pattern, in which over 50% of the lumen is filled by tumor cells. So this is way too much for high-grade pin. But it's not invasive, because you have basal cells at the periphery. And the nuclei are enlarged. These nuclei are about six times the size of normal prostate nuclei. So this case meets the criteria for introductal carcinoma of the prostate. There is an invasive component, which you can see is negative for basal cell markers. But you have the introductal component. And this is a very interesting entity. The vast majority of cases, and I'll show you the corresponding radical prostatectomy specimens in a second, but the vast majority of these so-called introductal carcinoma of the prostate is due to invasion, colonization by adjacent invasive tumor.

And it's at the periphery one frequently sees extravasated erythrocytes, siderophages, and",

There are a few lipophages and a very sparse infiltrative lymphocytes, and in this case, a few plasma cells, and of course, these findings are pathognomonic for lipodermatosclerosis, especially in this clinical setting.

And all that's left is sclerotic collagen, a little bit of the vascular branchy stuff and mature adipocytes with occasional little tiny lipoblasts, maybe a few pockets of myxoid change. And if there was a round cell component, you'll never know because it usually gets wiped out and blasted by the radiation. So I agree, that's the problem. The trade-off is that doing the needle ahead of time to get the diagnosis on a needle biopsy allows you to make a diagnosis and pre-treat the tumor. The trade-off though, is that on the excision specimen, you'll really never probably know what the original morphology was like. And I feel like this is one of the trade-offs we've made in modern medicine, where there are benefits of having a needle biopsy before excision, a lot of benefits and probably more benefits than risks, but there are some downsides. And that's one of them is pre-treatment, wipes out the original morphology. But again, it's the main difference is the prognosis. The long-term prognosis is worse, unfortunately, for patients that have high-grade round cell morphology. And even though the low-grade myxoid liposarcoma, in the past, there was a thought that like, 90% of the patients were gonna be okay and 10% would get METs. But I think with longer follow-up, we started to see that a significantly larger number actually even of people with low-grade conventional myxoid liposarcoma will get metastases. I think the WHO says, I think their current quote is between 30 and it's more than 30%, I think. And different studies show different things so that even sometimes it's longer and farther out.

And all that's left is sclerotic collagen, a little bit of the vascular branchy stuff and mature adipocytes with occasional little tiny lipoblasts, maybe a few pockets of myxoid change. And if there was a round cell component, you'll never know because it usually gets wiped out and blasted by the radiation. So I agree, that's the problem. The trade-off is that doing the needle ahead of time to get the diagnosis on a needle biopsy allows you to make a diagnosis and pre-treat the tumor. The trade-off though, is that on the excision specimen, you'll really never probably know what the original morphology was like. And I feel like this is one of the trade-offs we've made in modern medicine, where there are benefits of having a needle biopsy before excision, a lot of benefits and probably more benefits than risks, but there are some downsides. And that's one of them is pre-treatment, wipes out the original morphology. But again, it's the main difference is the prognosis. The long-term prognosis is worse, unfortunately, for patients that have high-grade round cell morphology.

And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia. The other observation I want to bring to your attention is the fact that this process is going in between benign glands, which means that it's almost respecting the benign glands next door. Because there are a number of processes that would destroy the adjacent benign glands and basically push them aside. But this process actually respects the benign glands, in quotes, and is actually going in between them, infiltrating in between them. And that's a clue to the diagnosis. Because as I hinted earlier, when you talk of tumors of the specialized prosthetic stroma, there are two main entities you think about. One is the so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. And the other entity at the other extreme is the so-called prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. Some argue that there's some relationship between both of them that are in the spectrum. But what you're looking at right now in this case, based on what I've shown you, this type of atypia, it almost looks simplistic. It has this degenerative type of look to it. We are not seeing mitotic activity. For something this ugly or that looks this nasty, you'll expect to see necrosis, mitotic activity, and even destruction of the adjacent glands. But we're not seeing that. And that's kind of a perfect picture for so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. As I said earlier, there's a relationship between this entity and prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. To start with, STOMPs can recur. About 15% of STOMPs can recur months or years after the initial resection. But about 15% to 20% of STOMPs may progress or may be associated with adjacent prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So that's a very important thing to know. Because STOMP itself, as the name implies, is of unsaturated malignant potential. So it should not be downplayed. Because some of you may ask me, how do I sign all these cases? It's very important in your comments to document what I just said, that about 15% of these, if it's just STOMP is here on the H&E, nothing else, it's important to document that about 15% would recur. And more importantly, it's important to document that about 15% to 20% of these may be associated with or progress to prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So it's not a case of they excise this and they leave the patient alone. They need to follow up these patients very closely. So that's very important to document in the report. So some of you may ask, OK, so what stains do we do for these cases? Obviously, you want to exclude a number of things. We talked about melanoma and other things. So you want to exclude those. So obviously, HMB45 melanin, those will be negative. Vimentin, which nobody uses anymore, is actually positive in this entity. PR could also be positive in this entity. Plus or minus CD34, plus or minus Desmin SMA, plus or minus ER may be positive, but it's usually negative. The pertinent negative stains are S100. I talked about the melanoma markers. And STAT6 is also negative. So it's very important to know that. So this is a stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. There have been a number of names for this entity over the years.",
        "corrected_text": " Something else you may have observed with this case is the fact that it's not just a stroma process. It looks like there's something else going on in the glands, too. And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia.

In this particular case, also the HHV8 stain was a negative, which would be positive in Kaposi's sarcoma. So the diagnosis in this case was a targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma, sometimes known as a hobnail hemangioma. Frequently has a characteristic clinical appearance, occurs commonly on the trunk or extremities. It is characterized usually by a central dark blue or purple papule surrounded by a zone of power and then an eccentric ring, which will slowly risk halt. These lesions will stain, frequently with CD34, but also are strongly positive for D240. So they probably are of lymphatic origin rather than vascular origin. What one looks for is a biphasic vascular tumor with this central area characterized by these dilated vascular channels.

And centrally, we've got embedded within a sclerotic stroma a second distinct morphologic population of melanocytes. Some of these are dendritic, others have spindle-shaped or fusiform-shaped",

Within that gland, this epithelium is growing and connecting the other side of the lumen. So the intraluminal proliferation of the epithelium is very,",

And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia. The other observation I want to bring to your attention is the fact that this process is going in between benign glands, which means that it's almost respecting the benign glands next door. Because there are a number of processes that would destroy the adjacent benign glands and basically push them aside. But this process actually respects the benign glands, in quotes, and is actually going in between them, infiltrating in between them. And that's a clue to the diagnosis. Because as I hinted earlier, when you talk of tumors of the specialized prosthetic stroma, there are two main entities you think about. One is the so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. And the other entity at the other extreme is the so-called prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. Some argue that there's some relationship between both of them that are in the spectrum. But what you're looking at right now in this case, based on what I've shown you, this type of atypia, it almost looks simplistic. It has this degenerative type of look to it. We are not seeing mitotic activity. For something this ugly or that looks this nasty, you'll expect to see necrosis, mitotic activity, and even destruction of the adjacent glands. But we're not seeing that. And that's kind of a perfect picture for so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. As I said earlier, there's a relationship between this entity and prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. To start with, STOMPs can recur. About 15% of STOMPs can recur months or years after the initial resection. But about 15% to 20% of STOMPs may progress or may be associated with adjacent prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So that's a very important thing to know. Because STOMP itself, as the name implies, is of unsaturated malignant potential. So it should not be downplayed. Because some of you may ask me, how do I sign all these cases? It's very important in your comments to document what I just said, that about 15% of these, if it's just STOMP is here on the H&E, nothing else, it's important to document that about 15% would recur. And more importantly, it's important to document that about 15% to 20% of these may be associated with or progress to prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So it's not a case of they excise this and they leave the patient alone. They need to follow up these patients very closely. So that's very important to document in the report. So some of you may ask, OK, so what stains do we do for these cases? Obviously, you want to exclude a number of things. We talked about melanoma and other things. So you want to exclude those. So obviously, HMB45 melanin, those will be negative. Vimentin, which nobody uses anymore, is actually positive in this entity. PR could also be positive in this entity. Plus or minus CD34, plus or minus Desmin SMA, plus or minus ER may be positive, but it's usually negative. The pertinent negative stains are S100. I talked about the melanoma markers. And STAT6 is also negative. So it's very important to know that. So this is a stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. There have been a number of names for this entity over the years.",

And all that's left is sclerotic collagen, a little bit of the vascular branchy stuff and mature adipocytes with occasional little tiny lipoblasts, maybe a few pockets of myxoid change. And if there was a round cell component, you'll never know because it usually gets wiped out and blasted by the radiation. So I agree, that's the problem. The trade-off is that doing the needle ahead of time to get the diagnosis on a needle biopsy allows you to make a diagnosis and pre-treat the tumor. The trade-off though, is that on the excision specimen, you'll really never probably know what the original morphology was like. And I feel like this is one of the trade-offs we've made in modern medicine, where there are benefits of having a needle biopsy before excision, a lot of benefits and probably more benefits than risks, but there are some downsides. And that's one of them is pre-treatment, wipes out the original morphology. But again, it's the main difference is the prognosis. The long-term prognosis is worse, unfortunately, for patients that have high-grade round cell morphology.

But I think with longer follow-up, we started to see that a significantly larger number actually even of people with low-grade conventional myxoid liposarcoma will get metastases. I think the WHO says, I think their current quote is between 30 and it's more than 30%, I think. And different studies show different things so that even sometimes it's longer and farther out.

And so if you haven't learned yet that a lot of times if there's a rearrangement of EWSR1 with some other gene, eventually someone's gonna find cases that have FUS rearranged with that same gene and vice versa because FUS and EWSR1 are similar genes, a kind of same gene family, which again, this is way over my head, I'm not a molecular pathologist.

If all the glands show patchy basal positivity, then that makes it an easy case. But some cases are tricky like this one, where some of the glands are completely negative for basal cell markers, while others are patchy positive for basal cell markers.

You should not render that diagnosis too frequently, otherwise your clinical colleagues won't trust your histologic judgment. So one has to be very careful with that. One should use that term very sparingly. So this is partial atrophy, and it's not unusual to have this kind of picture. If all the glands show patchy basal positivity, then that makes it an easy case. But some cases are tricky like this one, where some of the glands are completely negative for basal cell markers, while others are patchy positive for basal cell markers. But once you recognize on the H and E that both, you know, all these glands have similar cytologic features, both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, that should make your life very easy. So this was a very good case of partial atrophy. I have some other cases I'share with you very quickly. Similar scenario,",

And to complicate things even more, some of these glands are positive for racemase or amarkar, so-called amarkar, and that causes a lot of concern. So that's why they were struggling with this case, because if you see positive racemase expression, which is typically positive in cancer, and you see negative basal cell expression, the impression people have is that you're dealing with cancer. But that's not always the case, and that's why I'm sharing this case with all of you, because this is actually a process called partial atrophy. The glands I showed you on H&E are partially atrophic. You can still see some of it here. Some of them are cystically dilated here. In some areas you can see more cytoplasm. In other areas it looks more atrophic. So even on this paint cocktail, you can appreciate the partially atrophic features. So this is a benign process. You should not call this cancer, and you should not be too generous with your atypical diagnosis either, or some people call it atypical small atrial proliferation. You should not render that diagnosis too frequently, otherwise your clinical colleagues won't trust your histologic judgment. So one has to be very careful with that. One should use that term very sparingly. So this is partial atrophy, and it's not unusual to have this kind of picture. If all the glands show patchy basal positivity, then that makes it an easy case. But some cases are tricky like this one, where some of the glands are completely negative for basal cell markers, while others are patchy positive for basal cell markers. But once you recognize on the H and E that both, you know, all these glands have similar cytologic features, both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, that should make your life very easy.

And to complicate things even more, some of these glands are positive for racemase or AMACR, so-called AMACR, and that causes a lot of concern. So that's why they were struggling with this case, because if you see positive racemase expression, which is typically positive in cancer, and you see negative basal cell expression, the impression people have is that you're dealing with cancer. But that's not always the case, and that's why I'm sharing this case with all of you, because this is actually a process called partial atrophy. The glands I showed you on H&E are partially atrophic. You can still see some of it here. Some of them are cystically dilated here. In some areas you can see more cytoplasm. In other areas it looks more atrophic. So even on this paint cocktail, you can appreciate the partially atrophic features. So this is a benign process. You should not call this cancer, and you should not be too generous with your atypical diagnosis either, or some people call it atypical small atrial proliferation. You should not render that diagnosis too frequently, otherwise your clinical colleagues won't trust your histologic judgment. So one has to be very careful with that. One should use that term very sparingly. So this is partial atrophy, and it's not unusual to have this kind of picture. If all the glands show patchy basal positivity, then that makes it an easy case. But some cases are tricky like this one, where some of the glands are completely negative for basal cell markers, while others are patchy positive for basal cell markers. But once you recognize on the H and E that both, you know, all these glands have similar cytologic features, both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, that should make your life very easy. So this was a very good case of partial atrophy. I have some other cases I'share with you very quickly. Similar scenario,",

And all that's left is sclerotic collagen, a little bit of the vascular branchy stuff and mature adipocytes with occasional little tiny lipoblasts, maybe a few pockets of myxoid change. And if there was a round cell component, you'll never know because it usually gets wiped out and blasted by the radiation. So I agree, that's the problem. The trade-off is that doing the needle ahead of time to get the diagnosis on a needle biopsy allows you to make a diagnosis and pre-treat the tumor. The trade-off though, is that on the excision specimen, you'll really never probably know what the original morphology was like. And I feel like this is one of the trade-offs we've made in modern medicine, where there are benefits of having a needle biopsy before excision, a lot of benefits and probably more benefits than risks, but there are some downsides.

And in the glands, it's almost like there's a crosstalk between the stroma process and the glands. The glands are benign, but they actually have what looks like basal cell hyperplasia in areas. And that's not uncommon with this entity. It is not unusual to have this entity, actually, with basal cell hyperplasia. The other observation I want to bring to your attention is the fact that this process is going in between benign glands, which means that it's almost respecting the benign glands next door. Because there are a number of processes that would destroy the adjacent benign glands and basically push them aside. But this process actually respects the benign glands, in quotes, and is actually going in between them, infiltrating in between them. And that's a clue to the diagnosis. Because as I hinted earlier, when you talk of tumors of the specialized prosthetic stroma, there are two main entities you think about. One is the so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. And the other entity at the other extreme is the so-called prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. Some argue that there's some relationship between both of them that are in the spectrum. But what you're looking at right now in this case, based on what I've shown you, this type of atypia, it almost looks simplistic. It has this degenerative type of look to it. We are not seeing mitotic activity. For something this ugly or that looks this nasty, you'll expect to see necrosis, mitotic activity, and even destruction of the adjacent glands. But we're not seeing that. And that's kind of a perfect picture for so-called STOMP, stromal tumor of unsaturated malignant potential. As I said earlier, there's a relationship between this entity and prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. To start with, STOMPs can recur. About 15% of STOMPs can recur months or years after the initial resection. But about 15% to 20% of STOMPs may progress or may be associated with adjacent prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So that's a very important thing to know. Because STOMP itself, as the name implies, is of unsaturated malignant potential. So it should not be downplayed. Because some of you may ask me, how do I sign all these cases? It's very important in your comments to document what I just said, that about 15% of these, if it's just STOMP is here on the H&E, nothing else, it's important to document that about 15% would recur. And more importantly, it's important to document that about 15% to 20% of these may be associated with or progress to prosthetic stroma of sarcoma. So it's not a case of they excise this and they leave the patient alone. They need to follow up these patients very closely. So that's very important to document in the report. So some of you may ask, OK, so what stains do we do for these cases? Obviously, you want to exclude a number of things. We talked about melanoma and other things. So you want to exclude those. So obviously, HMB45 melanin, those will be negative. Vimentin, which nobody uses anymore, is actually positive in this entity. PR could also be positive in this entity. Plus or minus CD34, plus or minus Desmin SMA, plus or minus ER may be positive, but it's usually negative. The pertinent negative stains are S100. I talked about the melanoma markers. And STAT6 is also negative. So it's very important to know that. So this is a stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. There have been a number of names for this entity over the years.",

And it definitely looked a lot like malignancy, but there was something not right about it. So, this patient was receiving at the same time chemotherapy for his pancreatic cancer. One thing you can see in patients, especially when they're receiving radiation,",

It's some proliferation of cells here. And this is likely, it's a eosinophilic, well-encapsulated. So you think it's a neoplasm? Yeah, it's a neoplastic process that it's, yeah. So I'm seeing eosinophilic ball cells in the dermis. I don't think that I can say much more at this point. You can, you can. So do you think it's epithelial or non-epithelial? It's probably not epithelial. Good, good, good. And you know, at low power, that's fine. You can say probably this, because you're going to confirm it when you go to higher magnitudes. That's perfectly fine. At low power, sometimes you can make an instant diagnosis. If you see molluscum bodies at low power, you just move on to the next case. Or you see herpes varus, you're gone, you're finished. You don't have to waste time on it anymore. But if it's something like this, you say, well, yeah, it looks like it's probably non-epithelial. Sometimes you can get spindle-shaped cells in an epithelial neoplasm, like a squamous cell, spindle cell, squamous cell. So we're not sure, but you're right. At low power, it seems like it's probably going to be non-epithelial. Certainly doesn't look like any typical epithelial structure. And it's interesting. You said it looks kind of well-circumscribed. I agree. But it's got a, this is a pretty low power view, and it's a pretty big specimen. So it's large, and it's kind of bottom-heavy. So you said at low power, you thought it was malignant. So why did you say malignant? Sorry, I meant neoplastic. I don't think, I mean, it looks very well-capsulated, and it looks like it's probably completely removed. So I actually, I favor benign, but it might be benign. Yeah, I agree, it could be benign. But it does have a couple of features a little bit weird. It's bottom-heavy, which that kind of makes you say, well, you be careful, because bottom-heavy neoplasm can sometimes be malignant, even though they kind of look well-circumscribed. It's a little bit asymmetrical. We draw a line down the middle of it. I mean, this little piece over here is kind of sticking out versus over here. So it may be benign, because it seems to be well-circumscribed, but it's got a couple of criteria that we wonder at low power. Maybe we're going to make sure that it's not malignant. This may even be some necrosis on moss in here, which is another feature of malignant. So we're going to have magnification. Let's see what",
